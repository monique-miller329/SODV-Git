                <p> George Herman "Babe" Ruth .Jr was over a century ago on February 6th 1895 in the city of Baltimore, Maryland (Babe Ruth League, 2020). He was first introduced to baseball during his formative years.  Babe was tutored in the sport by a monk while he attended catholic school, which honestly sounds like the backstory for a comicbook character.  His prowess at baseball was unparlleled, which led to him being scouted by Jack Dunn, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, at only 19 years old (Babe Ruth League, 2020).  He was deemed <q>Jack's Newest Babe</q> by his fellow players and the nick-name would last him his whole career</p>
                <p>Babe started life anew as a pitcher after being sold to the Boston Red Sox in 1914.  Things were slow at first, but despite his limited appearances he made a grand impact on the playing field and was brought into the regular player roster by 1918.  His glory days at the Boston Red Sox didn't last long, as Babe was sold yet again to the New York Yankees in 1919. </p>

                        <q>He changed baseball from a grind it out style to one of power and high scoring games. He re-wrote the record books from a hitting standpoint, combining a high batting average with unbelievable power.</q>
