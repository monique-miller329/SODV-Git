            <section class="box2">
                <p class="aside-p"><em>"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"</em> is a song by new wave band Talking Heads, released in November 1983 as the second single from their fifth album Speaking in Tongues. The lyrics were written by David Byrne, and the music was written by Byrne and the other members of the band, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison.</p>
                <p class="aside-p">In the "Self Interview" on the DVD of the concert film Stop Making Sense, Byrne states that it is a love song, a topic he tends to avoid because it is "kinda big." He also said of the song:</p>           
                <blockquote class="aside-p">That's a love song made up almost completely of non sequiturs, phrases that may have a strong emotional resonance but don't have any narrative qualities. It's a real honest kind of love song. I don't think I've ever done a real love song before. Mine always had a sort of reservation, or a twist. I tried to write one that wasn't corny, that didn't sound stupid or lame the way many do. I think I succeeded; I was pretty happy with that.<sup><a href="#cite1" class="aside-cite">[1]</a></sup></blockquote>

                Make it up as we go along<br>
                Feet on the ground, head in the sky<br>
                It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing</p>

                I can't tell one from the other<br>

                Out of all those kinds of people<br>
                You got a face with a view<br>
                I'm just an animal looking for a home<br>
                Share the same space for a minute or two<br>
